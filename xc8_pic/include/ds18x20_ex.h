The 1-Wire bus must be switched to the strong pullup within
10Âµs (max) after a Convert T [44h] or Copy Scratchpad
[48h] command is issued, and the bus must be held high
by the pullup for the duration of the conversion (tCONV)
or data transfer (tWR = 10ms). No other activity can take
place on the 1-Wire bus while the pullup is enabled.
